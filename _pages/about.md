Hi there! My name is Jiaxu Lou, and you can also call me Julia. I am a huge fan of detective-themed works and Japanese animation. I have been a fan of the classic Japanese detective anime "Detective Conan" for six years. For academics, I am interested in psychology and Japanese cultural & animation studies.

### Animation Therapy Program (ATP)
I founded the Animation Therapy Program (ATP) to use animation as a creative medium for raising mental health awareness and fostering emotional healing. Inspired by the way animated films often reflect deep psychological themes, I wanted to create a platform where students could analyze stories, connect them with real-life struggles, and explore healthier ways of expressing themselves. Today, ATP has **over 80 participants**, and our work proves that animation can foster empathy, spark dialogue on mental health, and bring healing through creativity.
#### Film Analysis & Discussion
We analyze animated films in detail, connecting storylines with psychological theories. For instance, for the anime My Neighbor Totoro, we explored how the characters’ coping mechanisms and family relationships reflect children’s emotional resilience, providing insights into handling stress and anxiety.

#### Review Writing & Publication
Members collaboratively publish one review per month, highlighting how animation portrays themes such as resilience, grief, or identity. These reviews encourage open conversations about mental health in our school.

#### “Take What You Need” Sticker Series
I design and distribute stickers featuring images from animated movies as backgrounds, paired with inspiring or healing quotes from the films. Students can take these stickers to use as bookmarks or place them in notebooks. The series is called “Take What You Need” because participants are invited to pick the quote or message that resonates with them most, allowing them to receive personal encouragement and motivation whenever they need it.

#### Documentary Production
Partnering with the school photography club, we film documentaries capturing how students relate animation to their own struggles, making psychological ideas visible and relatable.

#### Concerts & Exhibitions
We organize creative events inspired by animated works, offering peers opportunities to express emotions through art, music, and shared experiences.
