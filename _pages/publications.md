During my high school study, I conducted in-depth investigation and research on some topics in AI, neuroscience, and psychology. Here are a list of my studies.

   Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Gemini have significantly advanced artificial intelligence by enabling machines to generate and comprehend human-like text. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs are not immune to limitations, including various biases. While much research has explored demographic biases, the cognitive biases in LLMs have not been equally scrutinized. This study delves into anchoring bias, a cognitive bias where initial information disproportionately influences judgment. Utilizing an experimental dataset, we examine how anchoring bias manifests in LLMs and verify the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of LLM responses to biased hints. At the same time, our experiments show that, to mitigate anchoring bias, one needs to collect hints from comprehensive angles to prevent the LLMs from being anchored to individual pieces of information, while simple algorithms such as Chain-of-Thought, Thoughts of Principles, Ignoring Anchor Hints, and Reflection are not sufficient.

## Other Research Studies
* Title: Artificial Intelligence in Education and Its Effects<br>
  Author: Jiaxu Lou<br>

   <pre>
  Abstract: This paper examines the development of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED). It describes how AIED can support personalized learning, provide adaptive feedback, and reduce teacher workload. At the same time, it shows how bias, discrimination, and unequal access may appear if systems are not carefully designed. Problems such as limited training data, digital divides, and cultural imbalance are discussed. The paper argues that AIED could reinforce existing inequalities if used without caution. It also suggests solutions, including diverse data collection, transparency, accountability, and system redesign. The conclusion is that AIED should be applied carefully, with strong protections, to make sure all students can benefit equally.

* Title: Reasonability of implementing Gender-Fair Languages based on evaluation<br>
  Author: **Jiaxu Lou**, Zisheng Wang, Zhongqi Yang, Rongtai Zhuo<br>

   <pre>
  Abstract: This paper studies whether Gender-Fair Language (GFL) is reasonable to use. Gendered language often strengthens stereotypes and reduces opportunities for women and non-binary people. GFL uses neutral or inclusive forms of expression to reduce bias. Research shows that GFL can change how people think, support confidence, and lower prejudice. The paper also notes that some people resist GFL because it feels strange or unclear, but provides examples from law, education, psychology, and linguistics to prove that it is possible to use. The conclusion is that GFL is a practical way to promote equality, especially when supported by policy and wider social use.

* Title: The Feasibility of Providing School-based Mental Health Services<br>
  Author: Jiaxu Lou<br>
  <details>
   <summary>See Abstract</summary>
   <pre>
  Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a significant rise in mental health issues, especially among teenagers. This paper discusses whether schools can provide effective mental health services to help address this problem. Schools are a key part of young people’s lives, and offering support in this setting may make it easier for students to get help, reduce shame around mental health, and allow staff to observe and support students in their daily environment. However, there are challenges such as limited time and resources, a lack of trained staff, and concerns about parental consent and rights. While school-based mental health services show promise, more attention is needed to improve training, secure parent agreement, and better integrate these services into the school system.

* Title: The Role of the Medial Nucleus in Amygdala and PTSD<br>
  Author: Jiaxu Lou<br>
  <details>
   <summary>See Abstract</summary>
   <pre>
  Abstract: Experiences of trauma can result in an inexorable mental affliction, namely post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A key brain region for processing emotions is the amygdala. This study discusses the pathophysiology of PTSD by reviewing current research data on the contribution of the medial nucleus of the amygdala (MeA). To elucidate the role of the MeA in both the initiation and maintenance of PTSD symptoms, I will investigate morphological and functional MeA changes. I also want to recommend certain treatment regimens.
