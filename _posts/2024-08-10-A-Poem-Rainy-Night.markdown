How should I face this rainy night,<br>
alone with the sky’s dripping tears,<br>
the puddles mirroring neon lights,<br>
the cold raindrops sliding past the window,<br>
the endless, transparent threads<br>
woven in the quiet air,<br>
the midnight wind swaying the branches?<br>

I stand by the window and watch<br>
the passersby lift their umbrellas,<br>
like mushrooms blooming in the rain,<br>
like a river of flowing colors,<br>
like the fleeting blossom of spring flowers.<br>

I watch<br>
the crabapple tree hung with tears,<br>
scattering rouge into the pond,<br>
its fragrance misting the air.<br>
I hear her weeping,<br>
her complaint:<br>
on the withered branches<br>
only a few pale-pink buds of hope remain.<br>
Her beauty has faded—<br>
only the cold rainy night<br>
knows it all.<br>

How should I face this rainy night?<br>
I cannot help but ask:<br>
why does the moon in the puddle<br>
always shatter at a touch?<br>
On nights of rain,<br>
is the starry sky forever hidden?<br>
Why does the joyful spring rain<br>
rage so wildly,<br>
mercilessly killing<br>
the peerless beauty of early spring?<br>
