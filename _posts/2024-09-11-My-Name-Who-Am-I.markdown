A name is the most original identifier of oneself. A name is the beginning of our communication with the world, the first sentence we use to introduce ourselves when entering a new environment. It is both the bridge that connects us with others and the bond that ties us to ourselves.

On the evening I arrived at Yale’s summer school, I had just moved into the dormitory when the Resident Assistant began roll call. When he reached my Chinese pinyin name, Jiaxu, the air seemed to pause for a second. We both felt a little awkward—he tried to pronounce it, and I tried to help. For him, a native English speaker, the sounds of Chinese characters felt unfamiliar and complex. Almost instinctively, I said, “Just call me Julia, it might be easier.” I thought this was the standard way to handle such moments, but he stopped me and said gently, “It’s okay if you want to keep your Chinese name. I’ll try my best to learn it.” At that moment, I felt uniquely touched by the Resident Assistant’s words. Somehow, in this unfamiliar land, my name suddenly carried a new weight and meaning.

The next day in class, the same problem came up when the professor called my name. Again, I said, “Julia is fine.” Yet, just like the Resident Assistant the night before, he asked sincerely whether I truly wanted to use an English name, and if I’d like him to try again. His question made me realize that this wasn’t only about pronunciation—it was about respect and recognition. That simple, repeated confirmation helped me see that a name is more than just how easy or hard it is to say. Behind it lies an invisible force: the weight of identity, the tether of culture. America, which once felt distant and foreign to me, unexpectedly revealed its tolerance and embraced me wholeheartedly. Perhaps here, some people are willing to take the time to learn about the pronunciation of a name, to understand the culture and story behind it.

A name is a symbol of identity. My English teacher once told me: People who are willing to learn how to pronounce your name are the ones who are truly sincere. If a person doesn’t even care to remember your name, perhaps they aren’t worth getting close to. I remember reading an essay by my English teacher when I first entered high school. Her story mirrored what I later experienced at Yale’s summer school, except she chose to keep her Chinese name. Keeping one’s Chinese name isn’t mere stubbornness; it can bring unexpected opportunities. She mentioned how, when classmates or teachers stopped in the hallway to confirm her name again, those moments felt warmer and more real. Through the simple act of practicing pronunciation, people found new ways of contact and connection.

The importance of a name goes far beyond being a tool of communication. It tells others who you are and where you come from. A name may be small and ordinary, yet it often holds the most genuine bond between people. Whenever someone makes the effort to pronounce my name“Jiaxu,” they are not just saying syllables—they are trying to understand a part of me: my culture, my story. That effort itself is a form of sincerity. A name, I realized, is the beginning of genuine dialogue.

A name is also a form of self-recognition. It is not just a string of sounds but a mark we leave upon the world. Changing a name might make life more convenient, but it can also bring a subtle sense of loss. In fact, whenever I see someone furrow their brow, struggling to pronounce “Jiaxu,” I don’t feel irritated—I feel a strange kind of anticipation, as if the communication has become more sincere. Even in China, the rare Chinese character “Xu” in my name often makes people pause. Many stumble on it the first time. But once in a while, someone gets it right immediately. That small surprise is impossible to describe—the sound of “Xu” feels like a breeze across my heart, proof of another person’s care and attention for me. Because of its rarity, the character has become more than just a part of my name—it is almost like a test, showing who pays attention to the details of my name. Those who take the time to look it up in a dictionary, to say it correctly, are often the most genuine and kind people in my heart. And indeed, my later interaction with them proved my initial feeling.

Perhaps it is these small moments that made me realize a name holds a deeper power. Choosing to change it may be for convenience or to avoid long explanations. But every time someone carefully asks again about the spelling or pronunciation of my name, I feel a quiet kind of closeness—an acknowledgment of who I am. I began to understand that each time I chose to keep my Chinese name, I was not only defending myself, but also my culture.

This reminds me of when I first entered high school and tried hard to blend in with classmates who were very different from me in personality. I even tried to change myself to share their interests. But I eventually discovered that changing my nature did not bring a true sense of belonging. Instead, it created a subtle sense of distance. Rather than forcing myself to fit in, it is better to be like a tree—rooted firmly in my own soil, waiting patiently for those who truly understand me to come closer. Later, when I found myself in the U.S. with classmates whose personalities and ways of thinking differed from mine, I no longer felt anxious. Instead, I learned to draw energy from their openness while keeping my own quietness and independence intact.

A name is the most primal marker of self. It is the very first bridge between us and the world, the first words we utter when introducing ourselves to strangers. It is both a bond with others and a tie to ourselves. During my summer at Yale, those who took the effort to say “Jiaxu” were really trying to know a part of me. It wasn’t just a matter of syllables—it was their way of telling me: I care about who you are. In a foreign land, keeping my name also meant keeping a piece of my truest self.
