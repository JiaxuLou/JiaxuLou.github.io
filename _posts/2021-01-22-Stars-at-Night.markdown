Perhaps I can<br>

Tuck colors into my pockets,<br>
And then<br>
Turn them all into stars,<br>
Scattered like specks across my heart.<br>

At that moment, my world<br>
Will shine brilliantly,<br>
The moon will peek out,<br>
And dark clouds will swiftly flee.<br>

At that moment, my sky,<br>
Even if still<br>
An endless night,<br>
It will be filled with countless stars.<br>
