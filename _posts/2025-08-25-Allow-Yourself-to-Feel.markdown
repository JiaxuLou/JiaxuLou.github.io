Today’s writing idea comes from a magazine article that left a deep impression on me. Yes, it was about emotions. The article tells the story of a little boy named Mark, showing that emotions don’t need to be suppressed, and that changing this situation can be as simple as asking: “How are you feeling today?”

Mark felt fear and shame because of his poor grades, which made it impossible for him to focus on his studies, trapping him in a vicious cycle. He was also bullied at school, and every day he would lock himself in his room and cry for hours. His parents loved him dearly. But loving someone doesn’t necessarily mean you can truly “see” them. As a child, Mark gradually learned not to let them “see.” He didn’t tell his mother or father; he swallowed all his sadness, anger, helplessness, and pain alone.

Reading this article resonated deeply with me. Emotional education is almost completely absent in our upbringing. Even when it exists, it often teaches us only to be strong, patient, humble, and not to make a fuss. These lessons all tell us to hide and suppress, rather than face, listen to, and care for our own emotions. As a result, we often do not know how to distinguish our feelings, ignoring them even when we are on the verge of depression and unable to save ourselves.

But the article also has a second part. Later, Mark’s uncle asked him a simple question: “Kid, how do you feel?” In an instant, the dam inside Mark burst, and his emotions rushed out. I loved a line from the article: “For the first time in his life, an adult truly allowed him to ‘feel.’” That afternoon, his uncle’s genuine question opened a heart that had been tightly shut for so long. His uncle sincerely wanted to know the answer and listened quietly, without judgment.

Often, when we most need care, emotional support is at its lowest. Because of the type of emotional education mentioned earlier, we may push away those who care at critical moments. So, to break this strange pattern, allow yourself to feel. Face your emotions, learn ways to cope, and let yourself be a little happier!
