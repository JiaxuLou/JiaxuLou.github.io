Today has been a completely “slacking” day. I “irrationally” set aside all my to-do lists and decided to write something. As I wrote these words, I had just taken a shower. After blow-drying my hair, I noticed a strand of bangs stubbornly refusing to fall into place. After nearly five minutes of adjusting, I finally gave up. Perhaps until the next shower, that lock of hair will remain disobedient; possibly, it is like my life itself—always filled with unexpected setbacks and futile struggles.

In this moment of leisure tinged with weariness, I recalled something I saw on TikTok a few days ago: a so-called philosophy called Antinatalism. Its central idea is that bringing a new life into the world may be a negative act, since all sentient beings must inevitably suffer, and no future life has ever consented to being born into this world to suffer. (Antinatalism is a philosophical view that holds that humans or other sentient beings should not have offspring, considering reproduction morally wrong or unreasonable. The core idea is that bringing a new life into the world is essentially a negative act, because life is inevitably accompanied by pain, and the act of reproduction itself cannot obtain the consent of the created newborns.) I resonated with this view and immediately shared it on my WeChat moments. For a fleeting second, I wondered, arrogantly, having often entertained such thoughts, do I also carry the mind of a philosopher?

The question of the birth of life and the meaning of existence seems to lie at the heart of this theory. Whenever I am asked about the meaning of life, I answer: “The meaning of life is that you cannot die, so you have to go on to take actions.” The humor in this remark masks a truth: since we have already been chosen by fate to enter this world of contradictions, pain, and fleeting joys, why not bravely endow our lives with our own meaning? We should make the best of this chance—this “lottery of birth”—and dare to search, experience, and grow according to our hearts. Perhaps life has no intrinsic meaning, and our only purpose is to live in a way that feels true to ourselves. In that authenticity lies the meaning of our own lives.

Returning to Antinatalism, it is not merely a questioning of procreation but a profound reflection on the essence of human suffering. Life is inevitably filled with regrets, disappointments. And pain follows us like shadows behind us. Yet, it is precisely this pain that shapes the brilliance of our fleeting moments. Growth is never easy; it comes with the sharp pangs of change, sometimes even pushing us to the edge of collapse. It was precisely the persistence and struggle that emerged from life in the face of these hardships that enabled us to overcome one hardship after another. For me, I often look back and wonder: How did I endure? That, perhaps, is the miracle of life’s tenacity. It is not the trophies we recall most clearly, but the countless memories of striving, of struggling toward dreams, of holding on against despair—that builds up the road of growth.

Back in my first year of high school, I once wanted to write a poem about spring, though inspiration has since left me. Still, in my phone, I keep a line that once moved me: “Between spring and me, there is a flower, a river, the wings of a butterfly; between spring and me, there are three hundred and sixty-five days of suffering to sadness.” Spring symbolizes growth and hope, yet it also carries the weight and hardships of the harsh winter that came before. This verse once struck me deeply: like the grass that rises again each spring breeze, we always find the strength to live anew. Between winter and spring, there are too many stories, but the key point is who can survive the winter. Suffering and setbacks are inevitable, but it is precisely these trials that grant us the resilience of life.

Now, with spring quietly arriving, I have finally fulfilled the dream about spring I held two years ago. Looking back, I remember the tears shed in moments of striving, and the silent anguish in times of failure. Yet these experiences have shaped who I am today and made me realize: we cannot choose our sufferings, but we can choose how to face them; we cannot control destiny, but we can live it with sincerity. Perhaps life has no predetermined meaning, but each of us, in our own way, colors it with our own warmth and depth.

On this seemingly aimless road, an occasional day of “slacking” is not abandonment, but rather self-mockery and a release of tension. Just like the unruly bangs, although there is always a moment when they refuse to obey, it is precisely this imperfection that constitutes the unique me. Perhaps we should all learn to find humor and comfort amid setbacks, to embrace life’s imperfections. Every fleeting moment may someday become the gentlest page in memory.

May life blossom with warmth in the ripple of the wind, not daunted by cold reality, nor afraid of the unknown ahead. No matter how rough the road, as long as we hold on to our love for life, even the smallest imperfections will become our unique scenery.

I finally finished what I wanted to write two years later in the spring.

May life thrive like the spring grass, unafraid of the bone-chilling cold of winter.
