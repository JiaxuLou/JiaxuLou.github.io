In between<br>
In the high school and college life<br>
In between<br>
The front porch and the foreign land<br>
In between<br>
Home town and a neon city<br>
In between<br>
Frightened exhausted and curious excited<br>
In between<br>
Reckless and responsibility<br>
In between<br>
Underestimated and overexpectated<br>
Who I am<br>
Who I’m gonna be?<br>

It is a paradox but an obvious reality<br>
That I am<br>
Dumb enough to think I know the whole world<br>
Smart enough to know I don’t<br>
Young enough to think I would live forever<br>
Old enough to know I won’t<br>

Sometimes I’m my mother’s daughter<br>
Sometimes I’m her friend<br>
Sometimes I play grown up<br>
And sometimes I play pretend<br>
Sometimes I a princess<br>
Dressed all ribbons and all curls<br>
But sometimes I just wanna scream I’m not a little girl<br>

Sometimes I feel I am stuck<br>
In between<br>
In my grown up self and my childhood<br>
In my ambition and simplicity<br>
