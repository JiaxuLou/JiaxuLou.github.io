Lately, while scrolling through TikTok, I often come across posts seeking all kinds of “buddies.” Now, there are “meal buddies,” “movie buddies,” even “Universal Studios buddies.” It seems as though finding a “buddy” has become the universal solution to our social lives. Last weekend, I suddenly saw a senior’s commentary article in my WeChat Moments, where he discussed “buddy culture” from the perspective of living in solitude. On one hand, I marveled at how pervasive big data has become, constantly exposing me to the word “buddy.” On the other hand, it sparked my own reflections. I would rather face solitude alone, embracing the peace and opportunities for self-growth that being alone brings. I believe that, although humans are inherently social creatures, we remain solitary beings at heart.

Of course, many people would argue against me, proudly proclaiming their “bros,” “besties,” or “soulmates.” Yet, we must admit that such intimate friendships are rare and can only be encountered by chance. Thus, we treat these friends as precious treasures. At times, we suffer from the emotional or physical distance between ourselves and our closest companions. This reminds me of Lu Xun’s story Run Tu, where the pure friendship between young Run Tu and Lu Xun was gradually eroded by time and social class barriers. But we may also view this differently: loneliness is not entirely negative—it can be a chance for growth and inner reflection. In childhood, our joys and friendships are many because our emotions are simple and our thoughts are shallow, allowing us to resonate with others easily. As we grow older, however, our emotions and thoughts deepen, making us more aware of ourselves and the world, and in turn, more solitary.

Why has “buddy culture” become so popular today? Beyond being a natural result of rapid social change, it also reflects psychological needs. In school, we want friends mainly to study, chat, and eat with us. In adulthood, “meal buddies” or “travel buddies” all reflect our search for suitable people to fulfill different social needs. Since it’s nearly impossible to find a single person who can meet all these needs, people choose to divide them into “buddies” in different areas. Within families, communication barriers also fuel loneliness. Teenagers often feel that their parents cannot understand their struggles, while parents may feel their children are overly sensitive. As students, we frequently experience stress, sometimes even breakdowns. When we complain to our parents—“I did poorly on today’s test,” “This teacher gives too much homework,” or “I’m overwhelmed, I can’t finish everything”—parents often respond, “We went through the same thing. Just hang in there. Don’t overthink. Everyone has to get through this stage in life.” Such responses leave us disappointed, because our desire to share and receive emotional validation is unmet. This is a form of loneliness—a generational gap caused by differences in age and experience. What devastates us may seem trivial to our parents, who have weathered far more. Thus, we inevitably wonder, “Why don’t my parents understand me?” Yet in truth, both parents and children are striving to understand one another. In all social relationships, we constantly seek common ground, striving for mutual understanding. This, perhaps, is the very meaning of life: breaking through obstacles, again and again.

Here I must clarify: the solitude I speak of is not the absence of companions, but the loneliness of thought and emotion that comes with growing up. Every person’s experiences differ. Family conditions, cultural background, values—these shape us in unique ways, making a universal emotional language nearly impossible. I often feel that human vocabulary is still inadequate to capture the richness of our emotions. Words like joy, anger, sorrow, and fear are too blunt to describe the subtle shades of feeling and thought that make up our existence. Precisely because of these differences, and because of our endless search for life’s meaning and the questioning of the soul, each person’s inner world is unique. Thus, there can rarely be true empathy. As the ancient Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi wrote: “You are not a fish, so how can you know the happiness of fish?” The insight remains relevant today. Yet these very differences make us cherish those rare friends who resemble us and make our friendship even deeper.

For instance, in the international department of schools, each student chooses different courses, tracks, majors, skill levels, and hobbies. Many face challenges of independent living, adapting to new environments, and academic planning. In this process, everyone is searching for their own path, and their thoughts and emotions may go through lonely stretches. Even with roommates and friends nearby, each person’s unique background, interests, and goals create emotional experiences that cannot always be shared. This loneliness does not stem from a lack of relationships, but from the personal, individual challenges of growing up. In such moments, meeting someone with similar experiences and shared interests feels especially precious. That resonance makes us feel understood and supported, turning friendship into a source of strength. This kind of friendship not only helps us get through lonely times, but also becomes even stronger because we have gone through similar challenges with our close friends. Thus, solitude is not necessarily negative—it can be an opportunity for deeper connections and stronger friendships.

The complexity of human emotions has long been a central theme in philosophy. We ponder questions like “I think, therefore I am” or “To be or not to be,” debating idealism and materialism. Though I have studied little psychology or neuroscience, I tend toward an idealist perspective: emotions form through life experience, and knowledge accumulates through reflection. This is why literature resonates with us; we can experience the emotional world depicted by the author with delicate words and capture those fleeting yet precious moments of profound emotions. The very meaning and value of great literature lie in this. The Chinese poet used the lines “Like a warbling oriole gliding below the blossom, like a mountain brook purling down a bank. Till the brook turns to ice, the strings seem about to snap, and for one instant all is still.” (Song of a Pipa Player), to describe the exquisite music played by a young girl; in the modern poetry "Dialogue with Coal", where the poet’s passionate cry when he converses with the coal that has been buried deep underground and remained silent for millions of years: "When did you become silent? From the era when dinosaurs ruled the forests, from the time when the earth's crust first trembled. Have you died in deep resentment? No, no, I am still alive - please give me fire, give me fire!", to the anticipation of the future expressed in the lines "Winter has come, but spring is not far off" (Ode to the West Wind by Shelley), and the pure and passionate love described in “’Tis a fresh morning for me when you are by at night." (The Tempest by William Shakespeare), words give voice to emotions too deep to speak. Even in today’s fandom culture, when people write “fanfiction” to explore imagined relationships, or scroll through social media to “ship” characters and savor bittersweet emotional twists, they are using words to seek resonance and fulfillment. Literature contains boundless emotions; it teaches us to draw inspiration from solitude, enriching our inner world through reading and writing. Loneliness, then, is not a monster to fear.

Picture this: on a cold winter night, you sit alone in your study, warmed by a cup of tea and enjoying the tranquility of a good book. This solitude might carry a touch of melancholy, yet also grants peace—a chance to step away from the noise and reflect on life. Also, imagine being abroad as an international student, a stranger to the language and culture, engulfed in loneliness. Such experiences reveal our smallness and vulnerability, yet also push us to grow, to expand our horizons. In daily life, too, when we feel lonely in a crowd, it may simply reflect differences in values, interests, or lifestyles. This loneliness is not bad—it reminds us to hold firm to our beliefs. It gives us space to reflect on ourselves and others, helping us cherish those who truly connect with our souls.

So, what I want to say is this: it’s okay to be alone, because everyone is essentially alone. After all, there’s a Chinese proverb:  “Beasts always walk alone, while cattle and sheep move in herds.” In solitude, we think more deeply. In solitude, we work more efficiently. Enjoy the freedom and joy of being by yourself. Reconcile with yourself. Understand your inner world. Become an independent individual who embraces loneliness.
