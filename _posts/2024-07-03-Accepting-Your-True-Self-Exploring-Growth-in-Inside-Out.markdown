When I was a child writing essays, I often used naïve words to describe my inner struggles: in my mind, a lazy little person tempted me to rest, while a diligent little person spoke to me, urging me to keep working. This kind of innocent and natural way of expression is vividly realized in the *Inside Out* series.

Looking back, in the first film, Riley was born with only Joy and Sadness. As a baby, she laughed and cried as the two controlled her emotions. As she grew, her experiences became more complex, and Anger, Fear, and Disgust joined the team. In *Inside Out 2*, Riley enters adolescence and gains even more emotions: Anxiety, Envy, and Embarrassment. This gradual “addition” of emotions feels strikingly real to me. When we were little, our understanding of the world was simple, and so were our emotions. As we grow up, we face more on our own—we think more, bear more, and rely more on our sense of “self” to solve life’s problems.

The part that resonated with me most in *Inside Out 2* was the appearance of Anxiety, the central focus of the story. During Riley’s crucial hockey tryouts, Anxiety took control like an orange lightning bolt, only to throw her mind into chaos. Instead of playing well, Riley stole from her teammates, injured her middle school friend, and was penalized. In the locker room, she spiraled into a panic attack.

Anxiety witnessed all of this yet felt powerless, with tears of guilt streaming down its wide, frightened eyes. This moment, to me, was even more touching than Bing Bong’s fading away in the first movie. Because in Anxiety, I saw myself. Peer pressure, craving recognition, replaying someone’s words or glances over and over—these memories became painfully vivid when the film showed Anxiety as a storm of panic. At that moment, I remembered countless anxious times: trembling uncontrollably, sweaty palms, a heart pounding as if it would burst, the ringing in my ears, that suffocating dread, and breathless despair. I once tried to ignore it or fought back with binge eating and staying up late. But *Inside Out 2* portrayed adolescence authentically, embracing every negative feeling. In a time when society tells us to be strong, rational, and never ruled by emotions, such honesty feels precious. For those struggling with anxiety or sadness, it is comforting, making them feel *seen* and *understood*.

As Asian kids, our teenage years often carry heavier burdens than failing to make a high school hockey team. It might be strict parents, crushing academic pressure, or the loneliness of daily life. If Riley’s adolescence is “easy mode,” then many of us have experienced “hard mode,” with little support available.

As Joy says, maybe growing up really does mean becoming less happy. That’s because the world we face grows more complicated, and we have more to consider. Along the way, we notice our flaws—but we must also allow ourselves to feel a full spectrum of emotions and embrace our whole selves. Anxiety often whispers, “I am not good enough.” I hope, after watching the film, we can change that to: “I am not good enough yet, but I am trying, so I don’t need to worry.” When we feel sadness, anxiety, helplessness, or despair, we must remember to be like Disgust, who rode the “broccoli boat”(Disgust hates broccoli but hops on a broccoli boat to save Riley), and learn to rescue ourselves.
