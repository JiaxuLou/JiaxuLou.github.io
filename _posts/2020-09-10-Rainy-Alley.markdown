Night—<br>
Deep and silent,<br>
Without a single sound.<br>
Suddenly,<br>
A gentle rain begins to fall,<br>
Pattering—<br>
The world comes alive.<br>


I play and frolic<br>
With the tamer of the wind,<br>
Walking through endless twisted alleys.<br>
I cannot find the door, cannot get out.<br>
Clutching a smile,<br>
I anxiously search for an exit.<br>
