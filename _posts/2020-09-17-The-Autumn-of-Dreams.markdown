Many people say that autumn is bleak and sorrowful, but I don’t think that’s necessarily true. What I love about it is the subtle coolness hidden within its warmth.

Autumn moves neither fast nor slow. The train of life is about to reach its final station, yet in these last moments, there is a gentle calmness and serenity.

The autumn wind is the first to announce its arrival. It tiptoes softly, and in just one night, the air seems to have cooled. But it’s not the piercing chill of winter. The autumn wind carries the lingering warmth of summer and the quiet cold of the coming winter. It feels smooth as silk, cool as water, gently brushing against your skin. A deep breath brings the mixed scents of fresh earth and ripe fruits—perhaps this is the unique scent of autumn.

The autumn sun is kind and gentle, using its last strength to shine. It is not as rosy as in spring, not as scorching as in summer, nor as gray as in winter. This is the privilege of autumn. The amber sun bathes the land in warmth, dispelling the cold and ensuring that hope is not absent.

Autumn leaves are often described with fiery reds and golden yellows, but I prefer not to focus on that. In early autumn, leaves wear yellow-green coats, aware that their time is short. They are gentle and charming; when the wind passes, they whisper secrets to it, rustling softly. Sometimes the wind, in impatience, blows them down, and the leaf bids farewell to the tree, providing nourishment for the next generation, falling gracefully without fear.

The autumn sky is the most tranquil of all. People aptly describe it as “clear and crisp.” The sky stretches in a deep, boundless blue that no spring, summer, or winter has seen. Occasionally, I catch sight of a playful little cloud, only for it to vanish moments later, perhaps playing hide-and-seek with me. Gazing at this infinite sapphire dome, I often think of the distant future.

People in autumn are busy yet joyful. Autumn is the season of harvest; after spring’s sowing and summer’s tending, they finally reap sweet, abundant fruits.

Autumn will always be my favorite season. In my seventeen years of life, I have experienced seventeen unforgettable autumns. Perhaps the winter after autumn will be harsh, but I will run tirelessly to prepare for the coming cold. After all, spring will follow winter. But before winter arrives, I must gather strength. I have never known fear.
