Once upon a time, in a magical kingdom called Beauty Land, the people's value and status were measured by their appearance. In this enchanting realm, those with high beauty ratings held the highest social status, securing the most prestigious positions and amassing great wealth. The people of Beauty Land were meticulous in maintaining their good looks, and it was customary for them to marry only those who possessed equal or greater beauty.

In the heart of this land, surrounded by lush forests and rolling hills, stood a grand castle belonging to the king of the country, who was known as the most handsome man in all of Beauty Land. After his gorgeous wife passed away shortly after giving birth to their daughter Snow White, he found himself in need of a beautiful partner to rule the kingdom alongside him. To find such a person, the king turned to the Magic Mirror, a tool used throughout the kingdom to judge beauty, as the Magic Mirror could honestly assess the beauty of anyone. 

So, the king stood before the Magic Mirror and asked, "Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?" The mirror replied, "Your Majesty, the fairest woman in the world is not within these palace walls but resides in a small village in the countryside. She has the rosiest cheek in the world, and her name is Rose Red." The king was astonished as he gazed upon the reflection in the mirror. There, he saw a woman washing clothes by the riverbank, her beauty unparalleled. Her hair flowed like golden silk in the gentle breeze, and her eyes shone like the clear blue sky. Her skin was flawless, with a natural blush on her cheeks that seemed to bloom with the radiance of a thousand flowers. Her figure was slender and graceful, like a willow tree swaying in the wind.

Overwhelmed by her beauty, the king ordered his subordinates to find this woman and bring her to the castle. They soon located her in the village and presented her to the king. Upon meeting her, the king was even more captivated by her charm and grace. He knew that she would be the perfect partner to rule Beauty Land alongside him.

And so, the king married the beautiful woman from the village, and she became the stepmother of Princess Snow White. As the years went by, the stepmother's beauty only grew more exquisite, and she maintained her title as the fairest in the land.

Soon after, Princess Snow White grew up into a beautiful young woman. With her skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as ebony wood, she was a spitting image of her mother. Meanwhile, Rose Red had always prided herself on her own beauty.

One day, Rose Red stood before the Magic Mirror, admiring her own reflection. She asked the mirror, "Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?" To her shock, the mirror replied, " You, my queen, are fair; it is true. But Snow White is still a thousand times fairer than you."

Rose Red's heart filled with envy and jealousy. She could not bear the thought of anyone else being considered more beautiful than herself. She began to plot ways to get rid of Snow White so that she could regain her title as the fairest in the land and maintain her status as the Queen, the highest position in the land.

As the days turned into weeks, Rose Red's paranoia grew stronger. She is afraid that Snow White's beauty will ultimately lead to her own downfall. She feared losing her status, her wealth, and the adoration of the people. The thought of being reduced to the laughingstock of the kingdom was too much for her to bear.

In a fit of desperation, Rose Red summoned the royal huntsman and ordered him to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. She demanded: “Take Snow White out into the woods to a remote spot and stab her to death. As proof that she is dead, bring her lungs and her liver back to me. I shall cook them with salt and eat them.” The huntsman, though initially hesitant, felt compelled to follow the queen's orders, as she is the most beautiful person in the land, and she holds the power.

As they ventured deep into the forest, the huntsman couldn't shake off the image of Snow White's beautiful face. The huntsman took pity on her because she was so beautiful, and he thought, "The wild animals will soon devour her anyway. I'm glad that I don't have to kill her." Just then, a young boar came running by. He killed it, cut out its lungs and liver, and took them back to the queen as proof of Snow White's death. She cooked them with salt and ate them, supposing that she had eaten Snow White's lungs and liver.

Overwhelmed with gratitude, Snow White thanked the huntsman for his kindness and ran deeper into the forest, seeking refuge. There, she stumbled upon a cozy little cottage belonging to seven dwarves. The seven dwarves asked Snow White who she was and how she had found her way to their house. She told them how her mother had tried to kill her, how the huntsman had spared her life, how she had run the entire day, finally coming to their house. The dwarves, seeing how beautiful she was but being treated so unfairly, decided to help her. Worried for her safety, they reminded Snow White: “We spend the days digging for gold in the mine. You will be alone then. Watch out for the queen, and do not let anyone in.”

The queen thought that she was again the most beautiful woman in the land, and the next morning she stepped before the mirror and asked: “Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who in this land is fairest of them all?” The mirror answered once again: “You, my queen, are fair; it is true. But Snow White, beyond the seven mountains, is a thousand times fairer than you.” She was so horrified that the blood all ran to her heart, and she knew that she had been deceived, that the huntsman had not killed Snow White. Because only the seven dwarves lived in the seven mountains, she knew at once that they must have rescued her. She began to plan immediately how she might kill her because she would have no peace until the mirror once again said that she was the most beautiful woman in the land. At last, she thought of something to do. She disguised herself as an old peddler woman and colored her face so that no one would recognize her, and went to the dwarf's house. Knocking on the door, she called out, “Open up. Open up. I'm the old peddler woman with good wares for sale.”

Snow White peered out the window, “What do you have?” “Bodice laces. Take a look, these are just what you need, my dear," said the old woman, and held one up. It was braided from yellow, red, and blue silk. “Would you like this one? It will surely enhance your beauty.” “Oh, no thanks,” said Snow White, thinking, “Why would I need something like that?” The old woman's eyes narrowed slightly, but she quickly hid her displeasure. She went away, muttering to herself, “She is not as foolish as she looks. I must try a different approach.”

But the Queen failed again, giving Snow White a comb to brush her hair. She can never understand why Snow White cannot be attracted to these precious things that can decorate the beauty of her appearance.

As time went on, Rose Red became increasingly tormented by the fact that Snow White was still alive. She was consumed with fear that she was no longer the most beautiful person in the kingdom. This fear gripped her heart like a vise, for she knew that without her beauty, her power would surely fade. Driven by this mindset, the Queen decided to make one final attempt. Rose Red went into her most secret room -- no one else was allowed inside -- and she made a poisoned apple. From the outside, it was red and beautiful, and anyone who saw it would want it. The apple had been so artfully made that only one side of it was poisoned. Then, she disguised herself as an old woman, went to the dwarves' house, and knocked on the door.

Snow White peeped out and said, “I will not let anyone in, for I must be careful with the Queen Rose Red.” “If you don't want to, I can't force you,” said the old woman. “I am selling these apples, and I will give you one to taste.” “It's so kind of you, but sorry, I won’t accept anything. I should protect myself instead.”

Seeing that Snow White wouldn't accept the apple, the woman reaches into her basket and finds another apple with shimmering red skin. The fruit glistened in the light, its glossy surface reflecting the warm glow of the sun. As she held it out, the sweet scent of ripe apples wafted through the air, filling Snow White's nose with its enticing aroma. She ate the whole apple and said, “Look, the apple is safe, you don’t have to worry. These apples are really tasty, don’t you wanna have a try?”

Seeing the tempting apple, Snow White couldn't help but feel a growing desire to taste it. The apple's shiny red skin and sweet fragrance were too much to resist. But Snow White still exercised caution. She knew that she must remain vigilant, especially after the previous encounters with the old woman, whom she suspected was the Queen in disguise. “Age before beauty.” Snow White said, wanting to make sure the apple was safe.

The old woman smiled as she took a small bite from the apple. “See, it's perfectly safe,” she said, holding out the partially eaten fruit for Snow White to inspect. Snow White carefully observed the apple, noticing that the bite mark was clean and there seemed to be nothing wrong with it. “Please, my dear, don't be afraid,” the old woman coaxed. “I promise you, this apple is as sweet as it looks.”

So, at last, Snow White reached out and took the apple from the old woman's hand and carefully took a bite. This time, fortune did not favor her; she fell to the ground and died. 
The Queen's heart raced with excitement as she watched Snow White fall to the ground, motionless. A malevolent grin spread across her face, illuminating the darkness in her eyes. She felt a surge of triumphant joy course through her veins, as if all her deepest desires had been fulfilled in that single moment.

That evening, the dwarves returned home from the mines. Snow White was lying on the floor, and she was dead. They could not bring her back to life. They had a glass coffin made for her and laid her inside so that she could be seen easily. Snow White lay there in the coffin for a long, long time, and she did not decay. She lay there as if she were asleep.

One day, a handsome young prince came to the dwarfs' house and wanted shelter for the night. When he came into their parlor and saw Snow White lying there in a glass coffin, illuminated so beautifully by seven little candles, he could not get enough of her beauty. He asked the dwarves to give her to him, for he could not live without being able to see her, and he would keep her and honor her as his most cherished thing on earth. Then the dwarves took pity on him and gave him the coffin.

When the dwarves carried the coffin to give it to the prince, a dwarf tripped. The terrible piece of apple that she had bitten off came out of her throat, and Snow White came back to life.

In the days following Snow White's miraculous revival, the kingdom was still reeling from the events that had unfolded. The news of the beautiful princess's return to life had spread far and wide, bringing joy and hope to the people. However, the celebration was short-lived.

Not long after Snow White regained her life, a shocking transformation occurred. The once-regal and beautiful Queen Rose Red, known for her stunning appearance and ruthless ambition, suddenly underwent a grotesque change. Her skin turned mottled green and yellow, her eyes bulged from their sockets, and her hair fell out in clumps, leaving her head bald and scabbed. Her once-perfect nose twisted into a hooked beak, and her mouth became a thin, sneering line.

The transformation was so sudden and extreme that it sent ripples of fear and confusion throughout the land. People who had once admired or feared the queen now recoiled in disgust at her sight. Rumors spread like wildfire, speculating on the cause of her deformity. Some whispered that it was a curse from the devils, a punishment for her evil deeds, while others believed it to be the result of dark magic gone awry. The once-proud queen, now a hideous mockery of her former self, was unable to maintain her grip on power. Her court advisors and loyalists abandoned her, seeking protection and guidance from the newly revived Snow White and her prince.

The king was devastated upon hearing the news of Queen Rose Red's transformation. He felt betrayed and ashamed, having married a woman who was an ugly mockery. As the most handsome man in the kingdom, he couldn't bear the thought of being associated with such a disfigured creature. His anger boiled over, and he demanded to know what had caused this horrific change.

Cornered and knowing that her secrets could no longer be hidden, Queen Rose Red revealed the truth. She spoke of her childhood, where she was ridiculed and tormented by her peers for her unattractive appearance. Her own mother, unable to bear the sight of her daughter's ugliness, had abandoned her, leaving her to fend for herself in a cruel world.

Because of her appearance, Rose Red had been denied opportunities and respect, struggling to survive in the lowest echelons of society. She had always been envious of those with beauty, who seemed to have everything handed to them effortlessly. In her desperation and desire for power, she had turned to dark magic, hoping to change her fate and take revenge on those who had wronged her.

However, the magic had backfired, causing her gruesome transformation. Now, as she stood before the king, a broken and deformed shell of her former self, she had lost everything – her beauty, her power, and now, even her humanity.

As the news of the queen's deception spread like wildfire, the citizens of the kingdom were consumed by a whirlwind of emotions. At first, there was a sense of disbelief among the people. They had grown up admiring the queen's beauty, and the thought of her being a fraud was too much to bear. They tried to convince themselves that it was all a misunderstanding, a terrible rumor that would soon be proven false.

However, the reality of the situation became increasingly difficult to ignore. As the people grappled with the reality of the queen's betrayal, their sense of righteous indignation deepened. They felt a profound sense of unfairness and imbalance in their lives. They wondered why they were subjected to a cruel ruler who manipulated the rules and played with their trust, while they themselves were confined by the rigid constraints of society, with their fates often predetermined by their appearance.

In response to this injustice, the populace rose in revolt. They seized the disgraced queen and placed her on an iron gibbet, hanging her high for all to see. Below her, a pile of burning charcoal was lit, and the flames licked at her feet for three days and nights. In agony and despair, the queen eventually met her demise.

The events had spun far beyond the king's control. When Snow White heard about the queen's tragic end, her heart ached with sorrow. She learns about her troubles and tragic past and understands why Rose Red tried to murder her. She felt a deep sympathy for Rose Red's plight and understood the people's anger and frustration. She began to ponder in despair, “These rules have brought so much injustice and suffering to the people, burying the dreams of so many talented individuals simply because of their appearance. So why are we following the rules of this world? Why does this kingdom, which should be filled with joy and laughter, instead resonate with despair and inequality? Why must we pay such a high price for the sake of beauty, and is that truly the meaning of life?”

Snow White questioned the mirror that the kingdom held so dear, saying, “Mirror, Mirror, on the wall, are you the truth or a standard for all? Am I but a pawn in this game of beauty's play, judged by my looks, as if that's the only way? Do you decide what's fair and just, in this world where beauty's the trust? Is this all there is to life? To be reduced to a face, a mere appearance’s strife?”

Snow White's voice echoed through the empty halls, a poignant rebuke to the mirror that had long held sway over the kingdom. She stared at her own reflection, seeing beyond the surface to the soul within. And in that moment, she realized that the true measure of a being lay not in the fleeting beauty of the flesh, but in the enduring spirit within.

The moonlight fell like silver on the quiet castle. Snow White stands alone in the ornate palace, her eyes fixed on the mirror. This mirror, once a symbol of power and truth, has become a shackle to the human heart. Snow White took a deep breath, her heart beating in the silence of the night. She stretched out her hand slowly, her fingertips touching the cold mirror. With a resolve as strong as the steel of the mirror's frame, Snow White lifted her hand and brought it crashing down upon the glass.

With a deafening crack, the mirror fell to the ground and broke apart. Shards flew like broken stars, glinting eerily in the moonlight. At that moment, time seemed to freeze, and the whole kingdom was shocked by this sudden change. The shards of the mirror shone cold, and Snow White stood among the shards, her eyes passing through the empty hall to the distant dawn.

She turned to face the court, her eyes blazing with determination. “No longer shall we be bound by the tyranny of beauty,” she declared. “This kingdom will no longer be a prison for dreams, where talent and worth are overshadowed by the whims of appearance. We will forge a new path, one that values the heart and soul above all else.”

Snow White's words ignited a spark in the hearts of those who heard her. They saw in her a leader who not only understood their pain but was willing to fight for their right to be seen as more than just their looks. The prince was inspired by Snow White; he changed his perception of the world, too. He is shocked by Snow White’s bravery and marries her. Soon, the king retired, Snow White became the Queen of Beauty Land, and ruled the kingdom with the prince. Together, they set out to dismantle the old order and build a new society based on the principles of equality, compassion, and the celebration of individuality.

The kingdom underwent a profound transformation. The rigid rules that had once dictated beauty and status were replaced by a more inclusive and equitable set of standards. People were encouraged to express themselves freely and to pursue their passions without fear of judgment or ridicule. And as the shackles of beauty's tyranny fell away, the true potential of the kingdom's people was unleashed.

Snow White, once known solely for her beauty, became a symbol of hope and change. Her actions proved that true power lies not in the reflection of a mirror but in the strength and courage to challenge the status quo and create a world where everyone can shine.

#### Writer’s Note

When I started to understand the fairy tale of Snow White, I thought it was just a very pedantic story, a boring story of a very old-fashioned princess being saved by the prince's true love. However, in the process of searching for materials in Part I, I found a lot of things that surprised me, and these understandings and perspectives of fairy tales were completely new to me. For example, it has been suggested that the story of Snow White is actually religious and that the apple in it represents the forbidden fruit that Adam and Eve ate. What interests me more is different scholars' analysis of the male power implied in this story. Many scholars have analyzed the differences between the original Disney version of Snow White and the famous adaptation of Snow White and the Huntsman in the portrayal of the heroine Snow White and the modern feminist thought reflected in it. When writing the Tale Analysis, I consulted more materials.

Some scholars say that the mirror in the story of Snow White is actually the reflection of men's examination and judgment of women's aesthetics. The two tools that the stepmother used to lure Snow White and kill her, the bodice lace and comb, were both used by women when they dressed themselves, demonstrating women's emphasis on appearance. In addition, after reading most of Snow White's variations, I found that these stories focus on the beauty of Snow White, and appearance is a major discussion point in these stories to a large extent, which determines the status of women in the stories. Therefore, I wanted to change this stereotype by creating an independent-minded Snow White who defies this emphasis on female beauty. When I was preparing for my speech, I wrote two poems, one from the perspective of Snow White and one from the perspective of the Queen. In thinking about how to create characters and speak for them through poetry, I learned more about the themes of my stories and came up with many ideas for words and phrases for my stories. Before the speech, the plot I had planned was that the queen made a deal with the devil, and she went from being a very ugly person who was bullied every day to being the most beautiful person in the country, and became Queen. Demons possessed the mirror very early on and created the rule that beauty was the standard in this country. The demon plans to inform the whole country that, knowing that Snow White's kindness and justice may prevent its plans, it deliberately says that Snow White is the most beautiful person, takes advantage of the Queen's jealousy, and uses its hand to kill Snow White. The queen failed and was punished by the devil to change back to her original ugly appearance. Snow White thus learned about the queen's experience and decided to change the rules after reflection, breaking the magic mirror possessed by the devil, making the rules specified by the devil invalid, and the whole country no longer evaluates a person by appearance. But this way of adapting the article might make it too long, and I have trouble finding a good reason why the devil wants to rule the whole country. But I also thought that if I kept to my original plan to write the story, maybe it would be more effective than expected because the readers didn't know the devil existed at the beginning, and I would just draw a story similar to the original Snow White story. Of course, the current story is also very good, and I think this story has well expressed the message I hope to convey. In the process of writing this work, my main challenge was to describe people's inner thoughts. I need to find very logical chains that show the changes in people's inner thinking and describe them in precise and powerful words and sentences.
