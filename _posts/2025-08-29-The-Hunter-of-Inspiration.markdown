I once read in a magazine that inspiration is like a child: sometimes it stands quietly in front of you, and sometimes it hides, impossible to find. This line has stayed with me, because inspiration is important and precious to all of us—not just because it allows us to create, but because it is rare and cannot be forced.

For example, right now, I am writing an article, but I don’t have many ideas because the “mischievous child” called inspiration is hiding and playing hide-and-seek. So I asked myself an important question: how can we capture inspiration in everyday life?

First, we can seize “highlight moments” in our daily lives. Take J.K. Rowling, the author of Harry Potter. In 1989, at 24, she was on a train from Manchester to London when she suddenly saw a thin, black-haired boy wearing glasses smiling at her outside the window. That was the origin of Harry Potter. She could find inspiration in daily life, refine it, and turn it into words. That is quite a skill! If life occasionally casts a little “magic” your way, then we should use it wisely, like Hermione, letting it become a spell flowing from our own “wand.”

We can also try looking from another perspective. For example, while writing this piece, I asked myself: what should I write? After thinking hard, I had no ideas. That’s because inspiration always reveals itself unintentionally; when we deliberately seek it, it often eludes us. So sometimes it’s better to step outside the current perspective. That’s how I decided to write this article about how to find inspiration. The result proves that stepping outside one’s mental frame can bring unexpected surprises.

Finally, I want to say: it’s okay if inspiration hasn’t come yet. Inspiration will always come, and it will always belong to you. If one day, after endless hiding and seeking, you finally find it, that’s wonderful. But even if it doesn’t appear, the moonlight, sunsets, books, paper, music, and rhythm are enough. Continue doing what you love. Inspiration belongs to everyone, to everyone who loves life. The joy and delight it brings from deep within are life’s greatest gifts.
