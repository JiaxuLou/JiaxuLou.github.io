It was an old street in a typical southeast city of China, the stone slabs polished smooth by time, with tufts of withered grass struggling out from the cracks. The sky hung low as if about to fall. Slowly, I stepped into this unfamiliar town. The air seemed frozen, except for the dim yellow glow spilling out of a shabby tavern not far away.

At that moment, the setting sun cast its light across the counter of the Xianheng Tavern. The smell of wine and sweat lingered in the air, as short-coated patrons crowded together, their eyes fixed on a single man—Kong Yiji. He wore a tattered long gown, his shoulders slumped, his body gaunt and pitiful.

“Kong Yiji is here!” someone shouted, their voice tinged with mockery. I stopped, my gaze falling on his lonely figure. He shuffled inside, and before he could even steady himself, the tavern erupted with laughter: “Kong Yiji, you’ve read books, haven’t you? How come you never even made it to first place?” The laughter carried lightness, carried joy, but not the slightest trace of pity.

Kong Yiji kept his head low and said nothing. In his hand were a few coppers, which he placed on the counter while muttering: “A bowl of warm wine, a plate of fennel beans.” The boy behind the counter slowly counted the coins. Laughter rippled again. Someone sneered, “Kong Yiji, did you steal books this time too?” Another chimed in, “Are you a fool? You can’t steal from Ding the scholar! Do you know how much his power is?” Louder laughter followed. Kong Yiji’s face twitched as if stabbed by a knife. He coughed and raised his head, his eyes flickering with stubbornness: “How can the intellectual’s affairs like me be called stealing? … To grab a book is not to steal!” His voice grew louder, desperate for recognition. But his words only fueled more ridicule.

I stood in the corner, watching. The gaze of the patrons pierced him like needles, but what tightened my chest even more was that their gaze itself seemed more humiliating than Kong Yiji’s plight. Those eyes carried derision, scrutiny, and a silent sense of superiority. People sought satisfaction in his downfall. Under their oppressive gaze, Kong Yiji had no space left to stand as a man. He became a symbol, an outcast. And yet, as I watched his hunched back, a chill rose within me—perhaps it was not only he who was dehumanized, but also those who thought themselves merely spectators.

Days later, in the town square, a crowd gathered. I pushed my way in to see a frail man tied to a wooden stake. His clothes were ragged, his face pale, blood trickling from his brow. He hung his head weakly, but when he occasionally lifted his eyes, they bore no fear—only scorn and defiance. This was Xia Yu.

The crowd’s expressions mirrored those in the tavern: excitement, indifference, even a touch of satisfaction. I saw a grey-haired man trembling as he handed over a few coins for a steamed bread stained red with fresh blood from Xia Yu. It was Hua Laoshan, whose son suffered from tuberculosis. He clutched the steamed bread in his hands as if it were priceless hope, rushing home with eyes bloodshot and a wrinkled face. He never questioned the nature of this “medicine” and whether this steamed bread with fresh blood from a real human could cure his son. He is an ordinary man, yet behind his ordinariness lurked the cruelty of ignorance.

My stomach churned. That was a steamed bread, but it was also blood—the condensation of ignorance and indifference. I stood still, and the noise from the onlookers became unbearable.

That night, lying in bed, the gazes replayed in my mind: the mocking eyes in the tavern, the feverish stares in the square, the desperate clutch of Hua Laoshan’s hands. These eyes were mirrors, reflecting numbness and apathy. I began to see: watching itself can be a silent violence, forcing others into humiliation, pain, even death, while the watchers remained untouched.

But was I really different from them?

I recalled Xia Yu’s eyes as he scanned the crowd before death—mocking, mournful. When his gaze met mine, I looked away in fear. I thought I was only a spectator, but I too was complicit. Those “being watched” were not merely victims. In silence, they saw through us, their gaze a cold blade cutting into our souls.

Later, people said a madman appeared in town. He muttered nonsense, was cursed, mocked, but always surrounded by gawkers. From afar, I heard him cry: “You can change—from the heart! One day, those who eat men will not be allowed to live in this world!” The crowd roared with laughter. But he did not laugh. His eyes brimmed with despair. His cry pierced me: he had seen the truth of the world, and he had seen our indifference. We, invisible beasts, stained our teeth with blood without ever noticing.

At dusk, I met a familiar face—Ah Q. He walked proudly, smiling as if the happiest man alive. Mocked, beaten, humiliated, yet he escaped through the “spiritual victory method.” His so-called triumphs were absurd and fragile, but they shielded him from the cruelty of others’ gazes.

Ah Q’s execution came months later. The crowd was larger than at Xia Yu’s beheading. Their gazes stripped him bare, leaving him a total failure abandoned by all. The spectacle of watching consumed his final dignity.

I once again witnessed prisoners paraded through the streets, dragged behind ropes, surrounded by eager onlookers. Even in chaos, people laughed, entertained by others’ suffering. Watching and being watched blurred into one.

When I finally left the town, I turned back with a heavy heart. Those gazes—mocking, indifferent, bloodthirsty—wove an invisible net, binding everyone. The world was full of devouring and being devoured; people grew numb in watching, and anguished in being watched.

And then I thought of Lu Xun, the creator of these characters with his pen. He too watched, but with his pen—not in cold detachment, but with profound pain and love. His “gaze” sought to awaken, not ridicule. In his article Call to Arms, he wrote: “But since a few men have already awakened, you cannot say there is no hope of breaking open this iron house.” His cry was not to terrify, but to remind: do not let your gaze become shackles upon others, nor let your soul be imprisoned by the eyes of the crowd.

At that time, China was engulfed in ignorance and darkness. Centuries of feudalism dulled people’s will; superstition and blind conformity thrived. People sought cures in blood-soaked steamed bread, mocked the poor, and turned executions into entertainment. This numb cruelty was the true sickness of the era. Through the works of Kong Yiji, Medicine, and The True Story of Ah Q, Lu Xun exposed these wounds—petty cruelty, blind obedience, and self-deception. His words pierced through the darkness, showing how the entanglement of “watching” and “being watched” had trapped a nation.

And yet, in that abyss, his gaze lit a spark: the belief that even within the iron house of despair, there might be those who are awakened, and they can further awaken others.

#### Background: About Lu Xun and the Works Mentioned
<font color= #c0c0c0 size=2>
*Lu Xun* (1881–1936) is one of modern China’s most influential writers and thinkers, known for his sharp critiques of social apathy and injustice. His stories often expose the cruelty and ignorance hidden in ordinary life, aiming to awaken the conscience of his readers.

The figures and scenes in this essay come from several of Lu Xun’s works:
* Kong Yiji (孔乙己), a story depicting the humiliation and marginalization of a failed scholar.
* Medicine (药), which tells of a father who buys a blood-soaked steamed bread as a cure for his sick son, symbolizing ignorance and blind faith.
* Diary of a Madman (狂人日记), considered the first modern Chinese short story, where the protagonist claims to see a world of cannibalism, exposing the metaphorical that feudal society can “consume human lives”.
* The True Story of Ah Q (阿Q正传), which portrays a man who endures humiliation through “spiritual victories,” reflecting the contradictions of national character.
* Call to Arms (呐喊), his first short story collection, where in the preface he speaks of writing as a cry to awaken the people trapped in an “iron house” of numbness.

Together, these works form not only a mirror of early 20th-century Chinese society but also a timeless reflection on human indifference, dignity, and the power of bearing witness.
