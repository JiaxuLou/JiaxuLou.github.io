*The Queen:*
As a little girl, I was ugly, a plain Jane, I'd say,<br>
Mocked and teased, every bitter day.<br>
I was forgotten out of view,<br>
So I pondered, wouldn't you?<br>
Why was I never given my due?<br>

But the wheel of fortune turns, and so it began,<br>
A deal with the demon, to alter my stance.<br>
Beauty beyond measure, a charmed life to lead,<br>
In exchange for my power, a deal I agreed.<br>

Power and drive<br>
They simply can't be denied!<br>
Now that I know, I swear I won't let them go.<br>
Cause being beautiful never feels so good!<br>
I played by the rules, but now I play the fools.<br>
The predator this time is me!<br>

Far and wide, I rule the kingdom with a heavy hand,<br>
But there was more I had in mind, a greater plan.<br>
I never wanted to share, so the king would have to fall,<br>
But his child blocked the way, the fairest of them all.<br>

In this realm of beauty, where charm is king,<br>
There can only be one, forever supreme.<br>
And I shall stop at naught to keep my throne,<br>
Even if it costs the life of the fairest soul.<br>

For in my eyes, the mirror never lies,<br>
And what it shows me, I cannot abide.<br>
She is a beauty that surpasses, a threat to my pride,<br>
I'll do whatever it takes to stay on high<br>

So let the dice roll, let fate decide.<br>
I'll play the game till the very end.<br>
For in the end, beauty is power, it's true,<br>
And I'll make sure that power belongs to me and me alone.<br>

*Snow White:*
In the realm of my birth, a princess fair,<br>
With skin as white as snow, hair black as night's despair.<br>
A world where beauty rules, and few dare to defy,<br>
A realm where looks alone decide destiny.<br>
 
Yet I wonder, is this all there is to life?<br>
To be reduced to a face, a mere appearance’s strife?<br>
I long to break free from this shallow shell,<br>
To show the world that I am more than just a belle.<br>

Mirror, Mirror, on the wall, <br>
Are you the truth or a standard for all?<br>
Am I but a pawn in this game of beauty's play,<br>
Judged by my looks, as if that's the only way?<br>
Do you decide what's fair and just?<br>
In this world, where beauty is the trust?<br>

No longer will I hide behind,<br>
The mask of beauty that was once defined.<br>
For I am more than just a pretty face,<br>
Rather a soul with dreams, a heart full of grace.<br>

Then turn away from the mirror's gaze,<br>
And fight for equality in the palace haze.<br>
I want to change the ancient ways,<br>
To build a world where all are praised.<br>
 
So rise and break the spell,<br>
No longer a victim of society's hell.<br>
I'll stand tall, with pride and grace,<br>
A true princess who saves the day.<br>

Let the Mirror shatter into a thousand shards,<br>
As I embrace the real me, unmasked and unafraid.<br>
For in this life, I'll write my own tale,<br>
Where beauty fails and love prevails.<br>
