At the edge of the lotus pond in late summer,<br>
The frogs open their concert,<br>
The crickets swing their long whiskers,<br>
Pulling at their beloved violins.<br>

The lotus maiden has already left,<br>
Leaving her little brother, the lotus pod, to play alone,<br>
A little bird sings a song,<br>
And becomes friends with the mischievous lotus seed.<br>

The lotus leaves still accompany the pond,<br>
The reeds laugh happily,<br>
I lie by the window,<br>
Waiting for the arrival of autumn.<br>
